# Sky Text Editor

A text editor written in the Skew programming language. It uses WebGL to render text at 60fps and implements selection, high-DPI rendering, scrollbars, keyboard shortcuts, clipboard support, syntax highlighting, and multiple cursors. It also has a 2D canvas fallback if WebGL isn't supported so text rendering works as far back as Firefox 3.6. Because it's written in Skew, the generated JavaScript is extremely compact (under 40kb at the time of writing). This is a toy project and is not intended for real use.
